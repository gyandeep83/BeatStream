# BeatStream

Work In Progress!

Built with Java, JSP/Servlet, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this user-
centric platform allows users to create, manage, and browse personalized playlists. Features include user authentication, playlist customization, genre-based music filtering, and dynamic song management. The application uses Apache Tomcat for deployment and integrates MySQL for reliable data storage.
Prototyped for scalability, supporting concurrent access by multiple users and dynamic playlist creation.
Implemented error-handling mechanisms to ensure consistent user experience during playlist modifications and
song retrieval.
